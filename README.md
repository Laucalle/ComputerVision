# Histogram of Gradients

This repo contains our implementation of the [*Histogram of Gradients*](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/triggs/pubs/Dalal-cvpr05.pdf) descriptor, by *Navneet Dalal* and *Bill Triggs*, along with a bit of further experimentation and some conclusions. Everything is documented in the report (in Spanish).

The code is written in **Python** and makes use of **OpenCV** and **NumPy**.
